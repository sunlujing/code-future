Here is a list of common technical questions asked at the Amazon phone interview: 

Find the top 10 selling products given the count of sales of each product. 
Design a valet parking lot with a basic use-case of assigning tickets to customers and retrieving the car later. Three sizes available. Use best fit and nearest distance.
There is a big file of words which is dynamically changing — words are being added to it continuously. How will you keep track of top 10 trending words at each moment?
Consider a distributed system with many clients and servers — each server exports a different set of services. Also, the computing power of each server is different. What data structures can be used in a router to perform load balancing?
How are requests handled in Resin (or a Java servlet container in general)?
How does dynamic recompilation work in Resin (or any other Java servlet container)?
What steps are taken when the OS shifts from one-thread execution to another?

You must keep in mind that Amazon is a data-driven company. Your focus should be on the question asked while ensuring your answers are well-structured. You can also provide examples using metrics or data if applicable. Reference recent situations whenever possible. 

Also, Amazon avoids brain teasers (e.g., "How many windows are in Manhattan?") as part of the interview process. The organization believes that those types of questions are unreliable when predicting a candidate's success at Amazon.
